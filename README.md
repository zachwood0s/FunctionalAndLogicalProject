# FunctionalAndLogicalProject

## Intro

This is the final project for my functional and logical programming class. Its a simple game written in LISP where the character is given a 4 x 4
grid with some x's in it. There are a certain set of moves (1-16) which flip the squares specified in that move. The goal is to get rid of
all the x's. Run it by loading the file into something like clisp and calling the Play function.
It also has an automated solver which will attempt to find a short solution to the problem. Run that with the Auto_Play function.
